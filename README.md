This repository contains code for Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) GRASP MRI reconstruction of abdominal data. 

Reconstruction code is available in two versions - written in matlab and python. 

## Demo

A tutorial is given in: 
`instructions/reconstruction/`

Please note that a copy of `input` and demo `output` data is not available in this repository due to Protect Health Information (PHI) restrictions. We intend to provide example data that has been anonymized very soon. 

If you are a collaborator on the DCE project with Computational Radiology Laboratory at Boston Children's Hospital, please contact [@sergeicu](https://github.com/sergeicu/) to request demo data example. 

   
## Attributions 

Matlab reconstruction code was initially written by [@kurugol](https://github.com/kurugol) and Onur Afacan, with further modifications from [@jcollfont](https://github.com/jcollfont/abdDWI). 

Python reconstruction code was written by  [@jcollfont](https://github.com/jcollfont/abdDWI). 

Both code bases were further modified by [@sergeicu](https://github.com/sergeicu/).
