##################### serge's notes - extracting dependencies of GRASP python reconstruction code. 


PYTHON reconstruction has 

1. Python dependencies 

2. Matlab dependencies 


##################### Python dependencies 


A. Gather `import` dependencies 
pip install pipreqs 

pipreqs .  # where . refers to `reconstruction_python` folder with python code  

B. Gather `sys.path.append` dependencies 
(unfortunately pipreqs does NOT list dependencies added via sys.path.append)

I've copied the following folders manually by looking at the python reconstruction code lines that used `sys.path.append`. 
The dependencies were copied into `reconstruction_python/ext` folder from: 
/home/ch199899/Documents/Research/DCE_all/




##################### Matlab dependencies 

THe matlab dependencies are a subset of dependencies of the FULL GRASP matlab reconstruction code. 
Therefore - simply addpath(genpath('../reconstruction_matlab/ext/')) inside the python file 


See the details of ../reconstruction_matlab/ext/dependencies_notes_ignores.txt for instructions how matlab dependencies were generated.
